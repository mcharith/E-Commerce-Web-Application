This application is designed to provide a seamless user experience by combining modern front-end and back-end technologies. The front-end is built using JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing interface. The back-end leverages the power of MySQL for efficient data storage and retrieval, while Java and Jakarta EE handle the application logic and server-side processing. This technology stack ensures the application is both robust and scalable, meeting modern web development standards and providing an intuitive user experience.
